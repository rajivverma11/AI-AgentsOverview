This project introduces an intelligent calculator that moves beyond standard numerical input by incorporating natural language processing capabilities. The system is designed to interpret user requests expressed in plain language and automatically select the appropriate mathematical function to fulfill the task. This is achieved through a modular design featuring several AI-powered assistant agents:

Multiplier Mike: An agent specifically trained for multiplication operations.
Adder Annie: An agent dedicated to performing addition calculations.
Exponential Eddy: An agent responsible for computing exponential values.
Divider Dongo: An agent designed for accurate division operations.
Modulo Mongo: An agent that calculates the modulo (remainder) of a division.
